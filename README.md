## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript

### What I learned

I learned to use the HTML Drag and Drop API along with the File API. I also learned how to link the drag and drop with the file input in order to validate the form whether a file was dropped or selected using the input.

### Continued development

In the future I'd like to continue to work with Web API.
